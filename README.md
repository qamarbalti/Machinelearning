# Implementation of decision tree for classification and 
function approximation
Machine Learning

Part 1:
In this section, we implement the decision tree algorithm for data description in the class without using 
libraries for the two criteria of Entropy and Information gain. Then, we take help from the dataset 
mentioned in the lesson slide to measure the implementation. The main code of the model is attached in 
the exercise file (HW1_Part1_401722316.ipynb), and in this part, only the learning results on the training 
data are reported.
In the figure below, the output image of the tree for the restaurant data is displayed, which corresponds 
to the image in the lesson slide. The name of the nodes consists of two parts, the name of the feature and 
the cut point.
Part 2:
Implemented in the notebook with the name HW1_Part2_401722316.ipynb.

Unfortunately, becauseof some issues I couldnâ€™timplement this part
